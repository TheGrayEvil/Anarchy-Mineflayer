# What is this?
Well, Read the name ``MineflayerAnarchy`` do you still dont understand what this is, Well its a simple **LIGHTWEIGHT** (Oh the text lightweight isnt light sorry.) Bot that allows you to Raid Servers/Do tasks in the game without opening minecraft itself. This bot can be operated through the web and contains many cool features try it out.

# Why is it named "MineflayerAnarchy"
There are many reasons why i rolled with this name the first one being i am bad at naming and the second thing being that the part Mineflayer stands for a npm package that makes this bot possible. You can check their source code [here](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer). And the last part "Anarchy" Signifies what it SHOULD be used for i.e botting anarchy servers. Also i shall not be held responsible for your actions ie if you use this and get ip banned etc.

# How to use?
Using this bot is pretty easy in itself all you got to do is to install the latest release from the release tab or if you think the folder is obfustacated look at the source and once done download the zip file.

After that please open up a code editor in the root directory that is where you have downloaded the bot for example if its still in the downloads folder open it up in the folder where it says "mineflayeranarchy-master" somewhat like that.

The third and final step includes downloading the dependencies and going to "localhost:3000" to do so please follow the commands below (execute them in the terminal of your code editor)
```bash
npm i 
node .
```
Now wait for it to say "Website Successfully loaded" and then open "localhost:3000" in your browser keep in mind that closing the terminal will cause it to stop
